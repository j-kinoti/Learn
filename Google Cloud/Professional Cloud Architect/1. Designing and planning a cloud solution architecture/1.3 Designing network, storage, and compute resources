Considerations include:

Integration with on-premises/multi-cloud environments
Cloud-native networking (VPC, peering, firewalls, container networking)
Choosing data processing technologies
Choosing appropriate storage types (e.g., object, file, databases)
Choosing compute resources (e.g., preemptible, custom machine type, specialized workload)
Mapping compute needs to platform products
